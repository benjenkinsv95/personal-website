          Hi there. My name is Ben Jenkins, and I'm currently finishing a masters degree in Software Engineering from
          Harvard Extension School.
          I expect to complete my degree in Summer, 2018.</p>

        <p>
          While I have experience developing software for robots, I consider myself a software generalist and craftsman.
          I'm a huge proponent of increasing software quality through developer testing, TDD, BDD, CI/CD, and
          refactoring.

          In 2013, I joined RoboKind as a developer, a company that builds humanoid robots that administer autism
          therapy. During my four year tenure with RoboKind, I worked on many fascinating features.

        <p>
          The most valuable feature I created was RoboKind's content authoring tools. With roughly 80 hours of my free
          time, I built the first draft of our content tools. Within the first year of having the tools available, our
          content authors were able to finish an entire year-long autism curriculum. The completed curriculum led to an
          increase in children treated and sales. </p>
